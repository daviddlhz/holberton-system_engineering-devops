### Network basics

Networking is a big part of what made computers so powerful and why the Internet exists. It allows machines to communicate with each other.

* What is a protocol
* What is an IP address
* What is TCP/IP
* What is an Internet Protocol (IP) port?

### Server

Servers are located in datacenters which are buildings that host hundreds, or even thousands of computers (servers). You can think of a server as a computer without a keyboard, mouse, or screen, that is accessible only by a network. A server can be physical or virtual. A server runs an OS (operating system).

### Web Server

Do not mix up web server and server.

A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

But you might hear people referring to a web server using the word server. (Check out the server concept page to learn more about this.)

As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM (Virtual Machine) or container.

### DNS

DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP

#### The root domain and sub domain - differences
A root domain is the parent domain to a sub domain, and its name is not, and can not be divided by a dot.

While creating any domain at a website of domain provider, the provider system will always ask you to choose a domain name without a dot in the name. In other words, the address of the root domain may be mydomain.com but it can never be my.domain.com. Domain providers block the ability to create such a root domain until you type a name without the dot. Why?

The dot in the domain name delimits the sub domain name (the part of the name before the dot, eg. www.my.) and the root domain name ( the part after the dot, ie .domain.com). This means that the address my.domain.com is a sub domain of the root domain, whose name is domain.com

In an administrator panel at domain provider account, you can create any number of sub domains. This means that for the root domain called domain.com it is possible to create different sub domains eg. my.domain.com, your.domain.com, holberton.domain.com… Creating multiple sub domains is always free and does not require you to set up new accounts on a domain provider website.

As you can see, all of the domain addresses used as an example (above) do not start with the www prefix. www is also a sub domain. The www prefix always leads to the main domain.

### Load balancer

Ever wonder how Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and other web giants are handling such huge amounts of traffic? They don’t have just one server, but tens of thousands of them. In order to achieve this, web traffic needs to be distributed to these servers, and that is the role of a load-balancer.

### Monitoring

Just as the heart monitor in a hospital that is making sure that a patient’s heart is beating and at the right beat, software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.

You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our software systems are doing is an important thing.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
